				<h5 class="title">Description</h5>
				<p>In October 2016, Seattle's KOMO News ran a scathing story about a major road improvement project intended to relieve traffic congestion in the city. "74 million later, Mercer Mess is 2 seconds faster" screamed the headline. The story is shown in the case part</p>
                <p>The implication is obvious: yet another colossal waste of taxpayer money.</p>
                <p>And indeed these numbers sound pretty bad, especially if you ignore the fact traffic along this corridor exploded over the duration of the project due to massive growth of Amazon and numerous other tech companies in the South Lake Union area. If we approach the situation with a mental model in which each Seattle commuter is assigned a specific route which her or she follows faithfully, the $74 million in improvements don't seem to have served the commuters along the "Mercer Mess" route very well at all.</p>
                <p>But pause a minute and think about how you expect traffic to flow in a big city during rush hour. The key is to think about traffic patterns as resulting from individual route choices made by tens of thousands of drivers. All of downtown Seattle experiences massive congestion during rush hour. The tight urban grid provides every driver with dozens of possible routes. Drivers that use these roads during rush hour are typically commuters who drive five days a week, month after month. They learn to adjust both their route and their travel times (where possible) in response to traffic patterns. As a result, we expect traffic patterns within the city to be some reasonable approximation of an equilibrium of the multiplayer game of "pick a route to get to work as fast as possible, given the routes that everyone else has picked."</p>
                <p>In this equilibrium model, improvements to travel times on a given route will transiently make that route faster and thus more attractive than neighboring routes. Additional commuters will shift to the newly improved route until travel times are again equalized. Under this model, that vast majority of the improvement in travel times on the enhanced road should be absorbed by increased traffic there. Indeed, this is exactly what happened in Seattle, as the KOMO article later admits. The Mercer corridor now handles 30,000 more cars a day than it did before the improvement project, without any increase in travel time. The headline might have read "Seattle road improvement project allows 10 million extra trips per year with no increase in travel times".</p>
                <p>Once we shift our thinking from a naive model in which improvements to a road affect only drivers on that road, to more reasonable model in which traffic patterns form a dynamic network across a city, it becomes clear that it's silly to quantify the benefits of improvements to one road by looking at travel times on that road. We can see that to measure quantify benefits, we need to integrate the consequences of an improvement project across all travels routes in that region of the city.</p>
                <p>A skeptic might ask why, for $74 million, you couldn't improve travel times everywhere by a substantial amount. In a modestly-sized town you might indeed be able to do it. But in a big city like Seattle with serious traffic issues and massive urban growth...well, remember that a decade back Boston spent 15 billion dollars on its "Big Dig." While Boston traffic is better than it used to be, the problems are far from eliminated. Unfortunately, $70 million dollars is small potatoes when it comes to fixing the traffic woes of a rapidly growing metropolis. If the use of those funds can keep travel times constant in South Lake Union for a few years, it's money well spent in our view — and we don't even have to drive there on a daily basis.</p>
